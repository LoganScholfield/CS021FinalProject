Recipies.py is a program I created in the fall of 2019 for the final project of CS021 Computer Programming. This program was created early in my studies of computer science. I find it interesting to look at the ways I tackeled some of the problems I ran into(Many of my solutions were not very efficient, but they did work).

To Run the program just download the file, or copy and paste the code. Run in any IDE for python version 3.7 or newer. When first running you will have to add some recipies, as there are no default recipies. Have fun exploring the program!
